Sample on Service Fabric using .NET Core for .NET Conf Bangalore edition. This code sample is slightly modified version of the sample that can be extracted from here: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/service-fabric-dotnet-quickstart, which also include some other great quick start examples. 

One can also refer to following documentation to recreate this sample on their own, slight differences are there in this code sample due to minor differences in .net core 2.0 (ex: HttpSysCommunicationListener has been used instead of WebListenerCommunicationListener)
